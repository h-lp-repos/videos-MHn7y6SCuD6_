**Estimated Duration:** 9 minutes

**High-Level Script:**
1. **Introduction to ReAct (0:00–1:00):** Define the ReAct framework, its motivation, and how it differs from standard prompt engineering.
2. **Framework Structure (1:00–2:00):** Explain the ReAct workflow cycle: Think → Act → Observe → Repeat.
3. **Prompt Architecture (2:00–3:00):** Show the anatomy of a ReAct prompt with clear annotations.
4. **Code Walkthrough (3:00–6:30):** Demonstrate the Python implementation of a ReAct agent handling a multi-step query, emphasizing reasoning and tool invocation.
5. **Live Demo (6:30–8:00):** Execute the agent on sample input, narrate the intermediate reasoning and action steps, and show resulting output.
6. **Best Practices and Pitfalls (8:00–8:45):** Discuss common errors such as prompt misformatting and tool registration issues, and how to avoid them.
7. **Recap (8:45–9:00):** Summarize essential points and transition to the next topic on custom tools.
