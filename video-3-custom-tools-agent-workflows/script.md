# Video 3: Designing and Integrating Custom Tools in Agent Workflows

**Estimated Duration:** 5 minutes

**High-Level Script:**
1. **Identifying Need for Custom Tools (0:00–0:45):** Outline scenarios where built-in tools are insufficient and custom tools are necessary.
2. **Design Principles (0:45–1:30):** Present best practices focusing on clear interfaces, robust error handling, and modularity.
3. **Tool Implementation (1:30–2:30):** Walk through coding a simple custom tool, such as a mock data fetcher.
4. **Integration into Agent Workflow (2:30–4:00):** Show registering the custom tool with the agent and updating the workflow to use it.
5. **Demo and Verification (4:00–4:45):** Execute the agent calling the new tool, verify successful outcome.
6. **Recap and Checklist (4:45–5:00):** Summarize integration steps and provide a checklist supporting robust tool development.
