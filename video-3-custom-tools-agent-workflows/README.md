# Video 3: Designing and Integrating Custom Tools in Agent Workflows — Recording Notes

## Suggested Timestamps & Key Points
- **0:00–0:45:** Outline scenarios for custom tools
- **0:45–1:30:** Present design principles
- **1:30–2:30:** Code tool implementation demo
- **2:30–4:00:** Integration into agent workflow
- **4:00–4:45:** Demo invocation and verification
- **4:45–5:00:** Recap and robust tool development checklist

## Recording Notes
- Highlight function signatures and registration steps
- Zoom on code for tool implementation
- Emphasize error handling blocks
- Use clear narration and closed captions

## Verification Checkpoints
- Agent successfully invokes the custom tool and returns expected data
- Error handling triggers correctly on invalid inputs

## Common Errors & Solutions
- **Agent cannot find the custom tool:** Confirm tool registration and imports
- **Unhandled exceptions in the tool:** Implement try-except blocks and input validation
