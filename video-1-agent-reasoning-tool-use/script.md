# Video 1: Agent Reasoning and Tool Use — From LLM Pipelines to Agents

**Estimated Duration:** 6 minutes

**High-Level Script:**
1. **Introduction (0:00–0:30):** Briefly introduce the lesson focus on evolving from static LLM pipelines to dynamic AI agent reasoning and tool use.
2. **Conceptual Distinction (0:30–1:30):** Define AI agents and contrast them with traditional LLM pipelines using a clear diagram.
3. **Why Reasoning Matters (1:30–2:30):** Explain the role of reasoning in enabling agents to plan and execute multi-step tasks effectively.
4. **Tool Use in Agents (2:30–3:30):** Showcase how agents call external tools, such as the calculator function, to enhance capabilities.
5. **Real-World Example (3:30–5:00):** Present a practical scenario where an agent answers a multi-step query by reasoning and invoking the calculator tool via live code demo.
6. **Mini-Demo Execution (5:00–5:45):** Run the code live: the agent receives a question, reasons through it, invokes the tool, and returns the answer.
7. **Recap and Transition (5:45–6:00):** Summarize key points and provide a preview of the upcoming ReAct framework topic.
