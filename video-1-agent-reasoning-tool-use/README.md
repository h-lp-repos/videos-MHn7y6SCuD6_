# Video 1: Agent Reasoning and Tool Use — Recording Notes

## Suggested Timestamps & Key Points
- **0:00–0:30:** Introduce static pipelines vs agent reasoning
- **0:30–1:30:** Define AI agents and compare to LLM pipelines
- **1:30–2:30:** Explain significance of reasoning in agents
- **2:30–3:30:** Demonstrate tool invocation (calculator)
- **3:30–5:00:** Real-world multi-step example walkthrough
- **5:00–5:45:** Live demo: reasoning, action, observation, answer
- **5:45–6:00:** Recap and transition to ReAct framework

## Recording Notes
- Use animated diagrams for pipeline vs agent comparison
- Zoom in on critical code sections; keep mouse pointer visible
- Highlight code outputs for clarity
- Maintain steady, professional narration
- Ensure closed captions are accurate and synchronized

## Verification Checkpoints
- Agent outputs intermediate reasoning and invokes calculator tool
- Final computed answer matches expected result

## Common Errors & Solutions
- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'**: Install dependencies (`pip install openai`)
- **Tool function not found**: Verify `calculator` function is defined and imported correctly
